Snow Data:

The metric I pulled to track the snowpack is the Snow Water Equivalent. This is the amount of water that the snow would produce if melted. The snow depth is the SWE * the snow density. Mountains it the Sierras are going to have higher density snow, therefore a higher Snow Water Equivalent. Unfortunately the density data collected by the Snotel sites is not as comprehensive as the SWE and, from what I found, didn't go back far enough. For this reason, care should be taken in comparing to tightly mountains west of Utah with those east of Utah. 


US Data:

The data for the mountains within the US were pulled from the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service report generator: https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/reportGenerator/

Sites were chosen from this map: https://bit.ly/2J9Izgt


The sites were chosen by proximity to the target ski mountain. The following are the site/mountain pairs:

Colorado			SnoTel Site Name
Steamboat Springs 	  	Tower
Powderhorn 	  	 	Park Reservoir
Snowmass 	  		North Lost Trail
Aspen 	  		 	Independence Pass
Crested Butte 	  		Butte
Monarch 	  		Porphyry Creek
Telluride 	  		Red Mountain Pass
Wolf Creek 	  		Wolf Creek Summit
Purgatory 	  		Cascade
Copper / Breckenridge 		Fremont Pass
Vail / Beaver Creek 		Vail Mountain
Keystone / Arapahoe / Loveland 	Grizzly Peak
Winter Park	  		Berthoud Summit
Eldora	  			Lake Eldora
	
	
	
Outside Colorado	
Jackson Hole			Philips Bench
Big Sky				Big Sky
Snowbird			Snowbird
Squaw				Squaw Valley
Mt Baker			Wells Creek

Canadian Data: 
The data for the two Canadian mountains was pulled from this site: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/water/water-science-data/water-data-tools/snow-survey-data/automated-snow-weather-station-data

Mountain:
Whister				Tenquille Lake
Revelstoke			Silver Star Mountain
