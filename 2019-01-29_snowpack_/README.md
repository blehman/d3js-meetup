Snow Data:

The metric I pulled to track the snowpack is the Snow Water Equivalent. This is the amount of water that the snow would produce if melted. The snow depth is the SWE * the snow density. Mountains it the Sierras are going to have higher density snow, therefore a higher Snow Water Equivalent. Unfortunately the density data collected by the Snotel sites is not as comprehensive as the SWE and, from what I found, didn't go back far enough. For this reason, care should be taken in comparing to tightly mountains west of Utah with those east of Utah. 


US Data:

The data for the mountains within the US were pulled from the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service report generator: https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/reportGenerator/

Sites were chosen from this map: https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/wcc/home/quickLinks/imap/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8ziPY0sHD0sgg283Z1NTAwcLZ3NQ3yCzQ28g0z1w_EqCDHTjwJKW1g4mxj6mxj4GHgbOBoEOlt4h5l5hBn6BxgR0O9kQJx-AxzAEaKfoPvxWBBFif-BCqLwOy9cP4qQkii8bnAipAAUB3gVGBvqF-SGAkGEQaZnuiIA34kK8g!!/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/#version=102&elements=&networks=!&states=!&counties=!&hucs=&minElevation=&maxElevation=&elementSelectType=all&activeOnly=true&activeForecastPointsOnly=false&hucLabels=false&hucIdLabels=false&hucParameterLabels=false&stationLabels=&overlays=&hucOverlays=&basinOpacity=100&basinNoDataOpacity=100&basemapOpacity=100&maskOpacity=0&mode=stations&openSections=dataElement,parameter,date,basin,elements,location,networks&controlsOpen=true&popup=&popupMulti=&base=esriNgwm&displayType=inventory&basinType=6&dataElement=SNWD&depth=-8&parameter=PCTAVG&frequency=DAILY&duration=I&customDuration=&dayPart=E&year=2019&month=1&day=24&monthPart=E&forecastPubMonth=1&forecastPubDay=1&forecastExceedance=50&seqColor=1&divColor=3&scaleType=D&scaleMin=&scaleMax=&referencePeriodType=POR&referenceBegin=1981&referenceEnd=2010&minimumYears=20&hucAssociations=true&lat=43.037&lon=-115.090&zoom=6.0
